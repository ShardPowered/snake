# Snake
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ShardPowered/snake.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains the code of Snake, the general Paper server management utility and heart of the [Shard](https://github.com/SnakePowered) ecosystem.

I've tried to make this configurable, however a lot of work can be put into making this thing more useful for the general public.

## A little bit about dependencies

Snake is build in top of [Easy](https://github.com/ShardPowered/easy), a Paper plugin framework.
It stores data on a MongoDB **replica set** (important!).

We use `gradle` to build the project.
